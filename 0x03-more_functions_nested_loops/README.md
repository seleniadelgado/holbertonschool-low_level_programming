Project 0x03-more_functions_nested_loops/
In this project I learned what nested loops are and how to use them.
What is a function and how to use functions.
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
What is a prototype and the scope of variables.
What are the gcc flags, -Wall, -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
What are header files and how to use them with #include.

0-isupper.c
_isupper is a function that checks for uppercase character using C as a
a parameter to check whether it is upper case or not. Returns 1 of c is
upperscase and returns 0 otherwise.

1-isdigit.c
_isdigit is a function that checks if the integer variable c is a digit from
0-9. Returns 1 if c is a digit and returns 0 otherwise.

2-mul.c
mul is a function that multiplies two integers a and b.

3-print_numbers.c
print_numbers is a function that prints the numbers from 0-9,
followed by a new line. _putchar can only be used twice in the code.

4-print_most_numbers.c
print_most_numbers is a function that prints the numbers from 0-9, but
does not print 2 or 4. _putchar can only be used twice in the code.

5-more_numbers.c
more_numbers is a function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0-14,
followed by a new line. _putchar can only be used three times.

6-print_line.c
print_line is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, using
n as the given variable to use for the length. Only uses putchar to print. n is
number of times the character _ should be printed. The line should end with a
\n. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n.

7-print_diagonal.c
print_diagonal is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal
using x and y as parameters and n to use for the length. Only uses _putchar to
print. Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed. The
diagonal ends with a newline and if n is 0 or less the function should
only print a newline.

8-print_square.c
print_square is a function that prints a square where int size is the size of
the triangle. Only uses _putchar to print. Size is the size of the square, if
size is 0 or less, the function should print onlye a new line. Uses # to print
the square.

9-fizz_buzz.c
int main(void) this function prints the numbers from 1-100, followed by a new
line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the
multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three
and five print FizzBuzz. Each number or word is separated by a space.

10-print_triangle.c
print_triangle prints a triangle followed by a new line. This function only uses
_putchar to print, sizeis the size of the triangle. If size is 0 or less, the
function should print only a new line. The character # is to be used to print
the triangle.
